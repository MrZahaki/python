# Processing heart rate oscillations during meditation
In this project, we used a heart rate timeline database for 5 different groups of healthy meditators to report most prominent heart oscillations during meditation practice in healthy young adults.

There has been much interest in heart rate dynamics during a variety of physiological and pathological states. In addition, considerable attention has been focused on the potential health benefits of a variety of meditative, relaxation techniques and their possible effects on neuroautonomic function.
